# PiArm

PiArm is a Raspberry Pi based DIY robotic arm outfitted with 6-axis digital computerized servo motors and 360 degrees of rotation liberation designed and developed for kids, makers, and techies.

**Steps for PiArm software installation:**
1. Open Terminal and download the code by writing:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sbcshop/PiArm.git
   ```

2. Your code will be downloaded to '/home/pi' directory. Use 'ls' command to check the list of directories.

3. Go to directory 'PiArm' and run the command to change the permissions of 'configGUI' and 'controlGUI' python files:
   ```
   sudo chmod +x configGUI.py controlGUI.py
   ```
   You are now able to run these two softwares for your PiArm. The control software is to control the movements of PiArm, while the config software is to config the servo motor.
   
   Kindly make sure that Serial Communication is enabled and serial console is disabled in the Raspberry Pi configuration.

4. Click on the 'Servo Config' shortcut icon to configure your motor, or if you wish to give movements to PiArm or if you control it, click on the 'PiArm' shortcut icon.

   ```

2. Run 'lcd_conf.py' file as superuser with display size as first arg and rotation angle as second:

   ```
   sudo python3 lcd_conf.py 7 0
   ```
   Note: Only two display configuration sizes are available 5 and 7 inch and the rotation can be 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree only.
